    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="hobby-text">
        <div class="hobby-scroll">
    <p>I must confess—I am a workaholic. I’m the kind of person who feels guilty when I’m not working. Lol.
        That said, I do have other passions. I love to travel. Though I haven’t explored much yet, the little I’ve seen has confirmed one thing: I’m a traveler at heart. This year, I’m excited to embark on a journey to five different countries—just the beginning of my global adventures.
        I have a deep appreciation for poetry and anything sentimental. As a Scorpio, I’m naturally drawn to depth, emotion, and the kind of beauty that stirs the soul. I also have a strong love for well-crafted language—proper English makes me swoon. I’ll admit, broken English in texts is a bit of a pet peeve!
        Fashion is another love of mine. During my fourth year at university, I even enrolled in a fashion design course. It was such an enjoyable experience, though I didn’t get to complete my final exams because they clashed with my degree project and finals. Still, it’s something I hold dear.
        I also enjoy singing and dancing, and modelling. </p>

      <h2><strong>BOLD. AUTHENTIC. INTENTIONAL</strong></h2>
      <h3>MEET LIZ JUMAH</h3>
      <p>Meet Elizabeth Jumah—a living testament to resilience, reinvention, and the extraordinary power of rising from rock bottom.
        Have you ever tried everything, only for nothing to work out? Elizabeth knows that pain intimately.
At just 21, she landed her first job at Unilever—an achievement many dream of. She quickly rose to become the Ambassador of the Unilever Foundation, a prestigious role that allowed her to travel and touch the lives of 2.5 million farmers in India. Her future sparkled with promise, and her life began to shift in exciting, bold directions.
But just two years later, at only 23, her world came crashing down. She was retrenched. One day she had a flourishing career—and the next, she had nothing. It was one of her lowest, darkest moments.
But Elizabeth made a vow: she would never go back to employment. Instead, she would pursue her dream—to become an entrepreneur.
What followed was a painful yet powerful journey. She started over ten businesses: Uber services, car hire, fashion blogging, jewelry making, magazine publishing, a cleaning company, tenderpreneurship, agribusiness, snack distribution, bookselling—you name it. And one by one, they failed.
By the end of three years, Elizabeth was drowning in debt. Her dreams had shattered. She was exhausted, broke, and broken.
With nothing left, she returned home to Western Kenya—carrying nothing but hope and a determination to rebuild. And rebuild she did.
Elizabeth founded Stery Supermarket and Bakery, which today employs scores of young men and women in her community. After three years of rebuilding, she asked herself a life-altering question: "How can I give back?"
And that question became the seed of a revolution.
Today, Elizabeth is the Executive Director of Wema Bukembe Development Organization, the Charter President of the Lions Club of Bungoma, the chapter president of DNALife Organization, Kenya, and the founder of multiple transformative projects that are changing the lives of over 5,000 people in her community.
Her pain became her purpose. Her brokenness became the foundation for others to rise.
Elizabeth Jumah is not just an entrepreneur. She is a community builder. A dream igniter. A social activist. A woman who turned failure into fuel—and is now lighting the way for others to find hope, dignity, and a second chance. In her presence, you’ll find more than inspiration—you’ll find a mentor, a compassionate ally, and a steadfast partner on the journey of transformation.
With Elizabeth, you’ll encounter real stories, hard-earned wisdom, and practical tools for rising again. This is not just motivation—it’s a movement.
Welcome to a journey of healing, discovery, and empowerment. Under Liz Jumah’s guidance, you’re not just surviving—you’re rewriting your story. Let’s begin, together.
